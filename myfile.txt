Though there were hardly any means of reaching from one part of the world to another; still the feeling of oneness existed. This is because the spirit of co-existence was strong enough to overcome any barriers of knowledge or distance. The search for peace in the universe was paramount. 
This is the reason that our sacred prayers always end with a prayer for peace. Not only that a meaningful prayer always starts with a prayer for wellbeing of all. Fracture or Violence; fear or force is far away from our ethos. 
We do not venture or advocate violence even through words or mind leave alone deliberate action. And in fact, violence or damage is not thought even towards the nature, including trees and animals.
That is why, India has always seen the domestic and the global as mutually reinforcing and inseparable parts of the same organic arrangement.
We rush to help people in need whether in neighborhood or far away locations. We have fought wars when no strategic interests of our own were involved. We believe that there is a higher cause and there is a higher duty than what we do in normal times.
